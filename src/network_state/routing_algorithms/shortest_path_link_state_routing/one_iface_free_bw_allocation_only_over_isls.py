    Calculates bandwidth and forwarding state (shortest paths via ISLs only, no GS relaying)
    and returns them as state objects, without writing to files.

    Assumptions:
    - "one": Each satellite/GS has one GSL interface (index 0).
    - "free": Bandwidth is managed per interface, and there is no strict requirement that
      bandwidth usage is reciprocated between nodes. Each node's interface tracks its own
      available bandwidth independently, allowing for flexible allocation without enforcing
      that if Node A can send to Node B, Node B must also be able to send to Node A.
    - "only_over_isls": Paths are GS -> Sat -> ... -> Sat -> GS.

    :param time_since_epoch_ns: Current time step relative to epoch (integer ns).
    :param constellation_data: Holds satellite list, counts, max lengths, epoch string.
    :param ground_stations: List of GroundStation objects.
    :param topology_with_isls: LEOTopology object containing the graph with ISL links calculated.
                               Also contains ISL interface mapping (sat_neighbor_to_if).
    :param ground_station_satellites_in_range: List where index=gs_idx, value=list of (distance, sat_id) tuples visible to that GS.
    :param list_gsl_interfaces_info: List of dicts, one per sat/GS, with bandwidth info.
    :param prev_output: Dictionary containing 'fstate' and 'bandwidth' objects from the previous step.
    :param enable_verbose_logs: Boolean to enable detailed logging.
    :return: Dictionary containing the new 'fstate' and 'bandwidth' state objects.

# --- IMPORTANT ---
# The function `calculate_fstate_shortest_path_object` (previously part of
# `calculate_fstate_shortest_path_without_gs_relaying` in `fstate_calculation.py`)
# needs to be refactored separately. It should:
# 1. Accept `topology_with_isls`, `ground_stations`, `ground_station_satellites_in_range` etc.
# 2. Perform the shortest path calculations using NetworkX on `topology_with_isls.graph`.
# 3. Determine the next hop for each (source_sat, dest_gs_id) pair based on the path.
# 4. Use `topology_with_isls.sat_neighbor_to_if` to map ISL next hops to interface numbers.
# 5. Handle the mapping for the first GSL hop (GS -> Sat) and the last GSL hop (Sat -> GS),
#    potentially assuming interface 0 on the GS and deriving the satellite's GSL interface index.
# 6. Return the forwarding state as a dictionary structure, e.g.:
#    fstate = {
#        satellite_id: {
#            destination_gs_id: (next_hop_node_id, next_hop_interface_index),
#            ...
#        },
#        ...
#    }
# 7. Remove all file I/O operations related to writing the fstate file.
